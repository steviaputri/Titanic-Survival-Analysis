# üö¢ Titanic Survival Analysis

## üìù Project Description  
This repository presents the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers who survived and those who did not survive the Titanic disaster. The project emphasizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships between features and survival outcomes. This project is part of my learning journey at the Faculty of Data dibimbing.id - Digital Skill Fair #38. It was an exciting experience exploring the Titanic dataset and applying real-world data science techniques using Python.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the Titanic dataset.  
- Clean and preprocess the data for analysis readiness.  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA to identify relationships between survival and features such as age, sex.  
- Visualize using the Python libraries.


## Method
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values by using modes for categorical columns and medians for numeric columns. Delete duplicate records to maintain data quality.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes the distribution of key variables and explores the relationship between various factors that affect survival, such as age and gender.
- Data Visualization: Create visualizations to support findings and make data interpretation easier
